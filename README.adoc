Test Bench
==========

TestBench is a testing framework for Ruby aiming to offer precisely what is needed to test well-designed code effectively and easily. In stark contrast to most other testing frameworks, test files are written using a procedural API, not a declarative one, which brings a score of substantial benefits in exchange for largely immaterial drawbacks. As a result, TestBench can be learned very quickly. However, users should not expect it to offer many palliative features that ease the difficulties inherent to working with vast, long-running, or brittle test suites. With that in mind, even those situations can usually be addressed with a little improvising.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

To install TestBench locally with rubygems:

[source]
----
> gem install test_bench
----

Or, to add it to a project's +Gemfile+ if using Bundler:

[source]
----
gem 'test_bench'
----

Next, write a test loader, e.g. +test/test_init.rb+:

[source,ruby]
----
# Begin test/test_init.rb

# Load Test Bench and then activate it
require 'test_bench'; TestBench.activate

# Load the code to be tested
require_relative '../lib/my/code.rb'

# End test/test_init.rb
----

Then add test files that require the test loader via +require_relative+. The typical directory to store test files is +test/automated+. For example:

[source,ruby]
----
# Begin test/automated/some_test_file.rb

require_relative '../test_init'

context "Some Context" do
  test "Some test" do
    assert(true)
  end

  context "Inner Context" do
    test "Some other test" do
      assert(false) # will fail!
    end
  end
end

# End test/automated/some_test_file.rb
----

The above test file can be run directly by ruby:
[source]
----
> ruby test/automated/some_test_file.rb 
Some Context
  Some test
  Inner Context
    Some other test
      test/automated/some_test_file.rb:12:in `block (3 levels) in <main>': Assertion failed (TestBench::Fixture::AssertionFailure)

----

To run all the tests within the +test/automated+ directory, the TestBench CLI can be used. The TestBench gem doesn't include an executable, so invoke the CLI from a file within the project (commonly +test/automated.rb+):

[source,ruby]
----
# Begin test/automated.rb

require_relative './test_init'

TestBench::CLI.()

# End test/automated.rb
----

Now use ruby to run the CLI:

[source]
----
> ruby test/automated.rb
Running test/automated/some_test_file.rb
Some Context
  Some test
  Inner Context
    Some other test
      test/automated/some_test_file.rb:12:in `block (4 levels) in load': Assertion failed (TestBench::Fixture::AssertionFailure)

Error Summary:
   1: test/automated/some_test_file.rb

Finished running 1 file
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s (0.0 tests/second)
1 passed, 0 skipped, 1 failed, 1 total error

----

After that, the project should be up and running.
